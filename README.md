# Members Only - Frontend

[![Vercel Deployment](https://vercel.com/button)](https://app.nevery.shop)

This repository contains the frontend code for **Members Only**, a real-time discussion platform built with modern web technologies. This application serves as a comprehensive showcase of a feature-rich, secure, and performant single-page application (SPA).

The live version of this branch can be found here: **[https://app.nevery.shop](https://app.nevery.shop)**

> **Note:** This repository represents the frontend for the monolithic deployment of the application. The ongoing development for a refactored serverless architecture is taking place on the `main` branch of the project repositories.

## üöÄ Features

- **Secure Authentication:** Robust JWT-based authentication flow with Access and Refresh Tokens.
- **Cookie-Based Session Management:** Secure `HttpOnly` cookies for refresh tokens to prevent XSS attacks.

- **Avatar Uploads:** Seamless image upload functionality integrated with Cloudinary for image processing and storage.
- **Session Management:** Users can view and revoke their active sessions from a dedicated settings page.
- **Dark Mode & Theming:** A persistent, system-aware dark mode built with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn.
- **Advanced State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for efficient server state caching, invalidation, and a seamless re-authentication flow.
